# pi-claude-bridge

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-claude-bridge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-claude-bridge)

Pi extension that integrates Claude Code via the [Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript).

> 🔱 **You're reading the [`tycronk20/pi-claude-bridge`](https://github.com/tycronk20/pi-claude-bridge) fork**, branch [`thinking-variants`](https://github.com/tycronk20/pi-claude-bridge/tree/thinking-variants). It adds: split `-thinking`/`-instant` model variants for adaptive Claude models, per-model effort mapping that exposes Anthropic's `max` tier (previously inaccessible from pi's selector), and `--thinking disabled` enforcement so `~/.claude/settings.json` can't silently re-enable reasoning. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and the "Provider" section below for details. **Install:** clone the branch, then `pi install <local-path>`.

> Built on [claude-agent-sdk-pi](https://github.com/prateekmedia/claude-agent-sdk-pi) by Prateek Sunal — the provider skeleton, tool name mapping, and settings loading originate from that project. The upstream [`elidickinson/pi-claude-bridge`](https://github.com/elidickinson/pi-claude-bridge) (which this fork tracks) adds streaming, MCP tool bridging, custom pi tool bridging, session resume/persistence, context sync, thinking support, skills forwarding, and the AskClaude tool.

1. **Provider** — Use Opus/Sonnet/Haiku as models in pi, with all tool calls flowing through pi's TUI
2. **AskClaude tool** — Delegate tasks or questions to Claude Code when using another provider

Uses your Claude Max/Pro subscription. I believe this is compliant with Anthropic's terms because only the real Claude Code is touching the API and it's to enable [local development](https://x.com/trq212/status/2024212380142752025) not to steal API calls for some other commerical purpose. That said, obviously this extension is not endorsed or supported by Anthropic.

## Install

```
pi install npm:pi-claude-bridge
```

## Provider

Each adaptive-thinking Claude model is exposed as **two `/model` variants**:

- `claude-bridge/claude-{opus-4-7,opus-4-6,sonnet-4-6}-thinking` — emits visible reasoning blocks
- `claude-bridge/claude-{opus-4-7,opus-4-6,sonnet-4-6}-instant` — runs without reasoning blocks (effort still applied to compute)

Plus `claude-bridge/claude-haiku-4-5` (single variant — haiku uses budget-based thinking, no effort knob).

Pi's `reasoning` slider sets the API effort tier. Mapping per model:

| Pi label | Opus 4.6 / 4.7 | Sonnet 4.6 |
|---|---|---|
| `minimal` | `low` | *(hidden)* |
| `low` | `medium` | `low` |
| `medium` | `high` | `medium` |
| `high` | `xhigh` | `high` |
| `xhigh` | **`max`** | **`max`** |

> ⚠️ **Opus labels are shifted down by one tier.** Anthropic's adaptive-thinking enum on Opus has 5 tiers (`low/medium/high/xhigh/max`), but pi's selector only has 4 useful slots, so we surface `minimal` and shift everything down one position to expose `max`. Sonnet has 4 tiers and uses the natural label-aligned mapping. Pi's selector intentionally hardcodes its own level names (per upstream maintainer), so the shift is here to stay — refer to the table above when picking a level on Opus.

Behind the scenes, pi's tools are bridged to Claude Code but it should all work like normal in pi. Bash commands get a 120-second default timeout (matching Claude Code's default) since pi's bash has no timeout by default. Skills in pi are copied over to Claude Code's system prompt so should work as they would with any other pi provider.

## AskClaude Tool

Available when using any non-claude-bridge provider. Pi's LLM can delegate tasks to Claude Code and wait for it to answer a question or perform a task. Examples of how to use:

- "Ask Claude to plan a fix"
- "If you get stuck, ask claude for help"
- "Ask claude to review the plan in @foo.md, implement it, then ask an isolated=true claude to review the implementation"
- "Ask claude to poke holes in this theory"
- "Find all the places in the codebase that handle auth"

You could also create skills or add something to AGENTS.md to e.g. "Always call Ask Claude to review complicated feature implementations before considering the task complete."

### Parameters

- **`prompt`** — the question or task for Claude Code
- **`mode`** — `read` (default, read files and search/fetch on web), `none`, or `full` (read+write+bash, disable this mode with `allowFullMode: false` in config)
- **`model`** — `opus` (default), `sonnet`, `haiku`, or a full model ID
- **`thinking`** — effort level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`
- **`isolated`** — when `true`, Claude gets a clean session with no conversation history (default: `false`)

## Configuration

Config: `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.json` (global) or `.pi/claude-bridge.json` (project; merged over global).

```json
{
  "askClaude": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowFullMode": true,
    "defaultIsolated": false,
    "description": "Custom tool description override"
  },
  "provider": {
    "strictMcpConfig": true,
    "pathToClaudeCodeExecutable": "/home/you/.nix-profile/bin/claude"
  }
}
```

`askClaude`:
- `enabled` — register the AskClaude tool (default `true`)
- `name`, `label`, `description` — overrides for the tool's pi-side name, TUI label, and description
- `defaultMode` — `"read"` (default), `"none"`, or `"full"`
- `defaultIsolated` — start each call in a fresh session (default `false`)
- `allowFullMode` — allow `mode: "full"`; set `false` to lock it out
- `appendSkills` — forward pi's skills block into the system prompt (default `true`)

`provider` (low-level SDK plumbing, most users can ignore):
- `appendSystemPrompt` — append pi's AGENTS.md and skills (default `true`)
- `settingSources` — CC filesystem settings to load; only applied when `appendSystemPrompt: false`
- `strictMcpConfig` — block MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` / `.mcp.json` (default `true`). Cloud MCP (Gmail/Drive via claude.ai OAuth) is always blocked.
- `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` — path to the `claude` binary. Required on **NixOS** (and other non-FHS systems) where the SDK's bundled musl/glibc binaries can't run. Set to your Nix-installed binary, e.g. `"/home/you/.nix-profile/bin/claude"`.

## Tests

`npm run test:unit` for offline tests (`tests/unit-*.mjs`: queue, import, skills). 

`npm test` for the full suite, which adds integration tests that hit APIs (`tests/int-*.{sh,mjs}`: smoke, multi-turn, cache, session-resume, session-rebuild, tool-message). Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_TESTING_ALT_MODEL` in `.env.test` for the alt-provider smoke test (e.g. `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7-flash`).

## Debugging

Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` to enable debug output:

- **Bridge log** at `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.log` — every provider call, session sync decision, tool result delivery, and CC's stderr. Override location with `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG_PATH`.
- **Per-query Claude Code CLI logs** at `~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/<timestamp>-<tag>-<seq>.log` — the CC subprocess's own debug stream, one file per `query()` call. Tags are `provider` (main turn), `continuation` (steer replay), or `askclaude` (sub-delegation). Useful when a resume fails or CC misbehaves internally — shows the CLI's own view of session loading, API requests, and tool calls.

When filing a bug about a session-resume failure (e.g. "No conversation found"), the most useful attachments are the `syncResult:` lines from the bridge log plus the matching `cc-cli-logs/` file for the failing query.

## Maintenance

After updating Claude Code or the Agent SDK, check for new built-in tools that may need adding to `DISALLOWED_BUILTIN_TOOLS` in `src/index.ts`. Unrecognized CC tools leak through to pi as tool calls it can't handle. Symptoms: "Tool X not found" errors in pi.
